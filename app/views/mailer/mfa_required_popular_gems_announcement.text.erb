👋 Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Effective today, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required on your RubyGems account.

<% if @user.mfa_disabled? %>
A number of operations are now restricted until you enable MFA.

These restrictions include editing profile pages on the web, signing in on the command line, and performing privileged actions (ie. push, yank, add/remove owners) (https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/#privileged-operations).

To re-enable these operations for your account, please enable multi-factor authentication 🙏.
<% end %>

For more information, check out our announcement (https://blog.rubygems.org/2022/08/15/requiring-mfa-on-popular-gems.html).

❤️ Thank you for making the RubyGems ecosystem more secure
