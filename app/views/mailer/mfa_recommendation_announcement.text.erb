👋 Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Today, we've announced our security-focused ambitions to the community. Attacks on the software supply chain are increasing and the second most common attack is account takeovers.

On August 15, 2022, we will begin requiring maintainers of packages with more than 180 million downloads to have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. Furthermore, we are officially recommending that maintainers of packages with more than 165 million downloads enable MFA. This recommendation will also be shown by the gem client. 

<% if @user.mfa_disabled? %> 
While this policy impacts specific RubyGems users, everyone can do their part to help combat account takeovers. 
Please enable multi-factor authentication on your RubyGems account 🙏.

We recommend setting the MFA level to "UI and API". However, "UI and gem signin" is acceptable too (https://guides.rubygems.org/setting-up-multifactor-authentication/#authentication-levels).

While this policy impacts specific RubyGems users, everyone can do their part to help combat account takeovers. Fortunately, you've already taken the first step! But, there's opportunity to improve.
Please upgrade your RubyGems account to a stronger MFA level 🙏.

Fortunately, you've already done that. Kudos to you 🥳 🙌!
