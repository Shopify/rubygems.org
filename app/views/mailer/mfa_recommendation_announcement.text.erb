👋 Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Recently, we've announced our security-focused ambitions to the community. Attacks on the software supply chain are increasing and the second most common attack is account takeovers.

On August 15, 2022, we will begin requiring maintainers of packages with more than 180 million downloads to have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.
If maintainers don't have MFA enabled by this date, a number of operations will be restricted.
These restrictions include privileged operations (ie. push, yank, add/remove owners) (https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/#privileged-operations).
Furthermore, we are officially recommending that maintainers of packages with more than 165 million downloads enable MFA. This recommendation will also be shown by the gem CLI.

<% if @user.mfa_disabled? %>
We're notifying you of this policy because you maintain at least one gem that has more than 165 million downloads.
So, we'd like to ask you to please enable multi-factor authentication on your RubyGems account 🙏.

We recommend setting the MFA level to "UI and API". However, "UI and gem signin" is acceptable too (https://guides.rubygems.org/setting-up-multifactor-authentication/#authentication-levels).
<% end %>

❤️ Thank you for making the RubyGems ecosystem more secure
